        <p class="paragrafo-02"> I am a future academic in Computer Science, currently living in SÃ£o Leopoldo, RS. I had contact with computing since I understand myself because of my uncle, who was studying Information Systems. <br>
            Since then I have always wanted to learn how to "make these programs" (which was how I used to say) and participate in all development, see ideas becoming reality. Whenever I can stop learning new things, since I was a child I have always been very "curious" on this issue. <br>
            My goal at the moment is to take advantage of all the content that the course offers me, learn as many things as possible and start to develop my portfolio in order to be able to apply for IT vacancies and also to be more prepared for graduation. <br>
            However, my final goal is to get an opportunity outside of Brazil, especially in the United States. Another dream that I developed when I was a child and carry with me today. <br>
